# Service Provider Login Flow - Verification Guide

## 🎯 Expected Flow After Service Provider Login

```
LoginScreen → Backend (/login) → Receives userType: "service provider"
   ↓
LoginScreen checks: if (type === "service provider")
   ↓
Navigates to: "ServiceProviderDashboardScreen"
   ↓
App.jsx Stack Router maps:
  <Stack.Screen name="ServiceProviderDashboardScreen" component={ServiceProviderDashboard} />
   ↓
ServiceProviderDashboard Renders (FULL FUNCTIONAL PAGE)
```

## 📱 Mobile Files Configured

### 1. **postJourneyMobile/App.jsx** (LINE 34)
```jsx
<Stack.Screen name="ServiceProviderDashboardScreen" component={ServiceProviderDashboard} />
```

## 🔧 Backend Configuration

### **backend/server.js** (LINE 16-27)
```js
cors({
  origin: [
    "http://localhost:5173",      // Web app (Vite)
    "http://localhost:8081",      // Expo web
    "http://10.63.72.99:5000",// Backend (self-reference)
    "http://10.63.72.99",     // Mobile app device
  ],
  methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],
  allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type"],
  credentials: true,
})
```
✅ Allows mobile app requests from `10.63.72.99`

### **Login Endpoint** (LINE 125-150)
```js
app.post("/login", async (req, res) => {
  // ... validation ...
  res.json({
    success: true,
    message: "Login successful.",
    userType: user.userType,  // ← Returns "service provider"
  });
})
```
✅ Returns `userType` field

## 🐛 Console Logs to Watch

When you login as a service provider, you should see:

```
🔍 LOGIN RESPONSE: { success: true, message: "Login successful.", userType: "service provider" }
🔍 USER TYPE: service provider
👨‍💼 Navigating to ServiceProviderDashboardScreen
✅ ServiceProviderDashboard MOUNTED AND RENDERING
📡 Fetching equipment stores...
✅ Equipment stores fetched: [...]
```

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

1. **Register a new user** as "Service Provider"
   - Name: Any valid name
   - Email: Any valid email (xyz@yourdomain.com)
   - Password: Must be 8+ chars with uppercase, lowercase, number, special char
   - User Type: **Service Provider** (from Picker)

2. **Login with that user**
   - Email: Same as registered
   - Password: Same as registered
   - Check console logs (should see the logs listed above)

3. **Verify you see the full dashboard**
   - Should display: "Service Provider Dashboard" as heading
   - Should show equipment stores list
   - Should have "Add New Product" section
   - Should have editable products with images

## ❌ If Still Seeing "Just 2 Words" (Simple Page)

This means the navigation is going to the **wrong component** (ServiceProviderScreen.js)

**Check:**
- [ ] App.jsx line 34 is exactly: `<Stack.Screen name="ServiceProviderDashboardScreen" component={ServiceProviderDashboard} />`
- [ ] LoginScreen.jsx line 48 is exactly: `navigation.navigate("ServiceProviderDashboardScreen", { userEmail: email })`
- [ ] Backend returns `userType: "service provider"` (with space, not underscore)
- [ ] Expo cache was cleared: `expo start -c`

---

## 🚀 Commands to Run

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Backend
cd backend
npm start

# Terminal 2: Start Mobile App (with cache clear)
cd postJourneyMobile
expo start -c

# Then press 'a' to open Android Emulator
# Or scan QR code with Expo Go on physical device
```
